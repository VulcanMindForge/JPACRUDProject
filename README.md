# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jacob Stuart
### Programming student with Skill Distillery

- Iâ€™m currently working on [JPACRUDProject](https://github.com/VulcanMindForge/JPACRUDProject)

# Description of this project
Database interface for viewing, editing, adding, and removing books.

# How to use this project
The main page will show all books currently in the database. Select Home from the top left to return to this page at any time. You can select the Edit or Delete button to edit that book or remove it from the database. You will be taken to a full details page and asked to confirm. In the top right you can search for a book by ID at any time.

# Technologies Used
Overall I am learning full stack developement. Previously I was trying to use as many topics as possible to increase my understanding and retention. Moving forward, I will be trying to keep the topics down to only what seems best for the program.

I will be pulling from the following languages.
- Java 1.8
- MySQL
- Maven
- SpringBoot
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Java Persistence API
- Gradle with Groovy

# Current Progress
- Initialized class
- Created Database
- Implemented Controller
- Database Access Object created
- Set up views

# Next Steps
- Set more tables in database
- implement controller methods to join tables and pull more information
- Post to AWS

# Lessons learned or reinforced on this project
- Transactional and Service annotations
- Tag library and single page view control
- Managed vs unmanaged objects in relation to database

# Lessons to research
- Database manipulation
- Bootstrap improvements
- When to use seperate views or set a single page to change views.
